estimate mean & covariance with prior info(shrinkage)


In the small sample regime, the main source of error comes from the variance of the estimator，lower estimation errors can be achieved by allowing some bias in exchange of a smaller variance. This can be implemented by shrinking the estimator to some known target values.


θ^sh = (1 ? ρ) θ^ + ρθtarget

ρ and θtarget 是主观的

shrinkage factor ρ is critical for the success of the
shrinkage estimator， even if θtarget is uninformative

可以使用交叉验证或者随机矩阵论(不是很合适有限制)来确定ρ
