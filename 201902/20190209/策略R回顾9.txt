Portfolio Optimization with Alternative Risk Measures


consider more meaningful measures for risk：
downside risk(DR), Value-at-Risk(VaR), Conditional VaR(CVaR) or Expected Shortfall (ES), and drawdown (DD)


mean-DR portfolio: under semivariance, convex QP
mean-VaR/CVaR portfolio: can be approximated by an LP
mean-DD portfolio: under max/average DD or CDaR, model is  LP
关于使用DD的警示 ：
1.maximum drawdown is extremely sensitive to minute changes in the portfolio weights and to the specifc time period examined
2.wouldn’t choose weights that minimize historical drawdown,因为会使计算出来的权重失真，而是you might just include terms in your optimization objective that penalize negative skew and penalize positive kurtosis.
